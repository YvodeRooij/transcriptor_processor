Jaap Vriesendorp (JV) - Managing Partner, Welt & Marktlink Capital
Jan Vriesendorp (JVE) - Partner, Egeria
Sarah Wilson (SW) - Investment Director, Egeria


JV: Thanks for making time today, Jan. We've been following Egeria's progress closely, particularly your recent exits.
JVE: Of course, always good to catch up. Yes, we've had a strong year, particularly with the ServiceNow implementation partner we backed in 2019. That exit gave us a 4.2x return.
JV: That's impressive. I understand you're raising Fund VI now?
JVE: Yes, we're targeting €1.2 billion. We've already secured about €800 million in commitments, including €150 million from our existing LP base. The first close is planned for Q1 2025.
SW: And importantly, the entire partner group is committing €60 million personally, which is a 20% increase from Fund V.
JV: That's significant alignment. What's driving the larger fund size compared to Fund V?
JVE: We're seeing more opportunities in the upper mid-market, particularly in software and tech-enabled services. The average EBITDA of our target companies has increased from €25 million to €35-40 million.
SW: Our tech portfolio has been performing particularly well. The digital transformation company we backed in Germany has grown from €45 million to €95 million in revenue in just 18 months, both organically and through three add-on acquisitions.
JV: What's your view on valuations in that space?
JVE: They're still high, but we're seeing more realistic expectations now. We're focusing on companies with strong recurring revenue - our portfolio average is 70% recurring revenue. We typically look for at least 60% gross margins and 20%+ EBITDA margins.
JV: And the investment strategy remains similar?
JVE: Yes, but with some refinements. We're still doing 8-10 platform investments per fund, €50-150 million equity tickets. But we've built out our digital team - now 6 people focused on digital transformation. They've been crucial in our recent exits.
SW: We've also strengthened our ESG capabilities. Our portfolio companies have reduced their carbon footprint by 25% on average over the hold period.
JV: What about your deal sourcing? The market seems quite competitive.
JVE: We've maintained our approach of 80% proprietary deals. Our sector teams have been building relationships with targets years before they're ready to transact. Last year, we looked at 245 opportunities and completed 3 new platform investments.
SW: And we're seeing more carve-out opportunities now. We just closed a deal to acquire a division of a listed German industrial company - their IoT solutions business.
JV: How's Fund V performing? I recall you had some supply chain challenges with the packaging company.
JVE: Fund V is tracking at 2.1x gross MOIC currently. The packaging company took a hit in 2022, but we've resolved the issues. Brought in a new COO from DSM, restructured the Asian operations. It's back to 15% EBITDA margins now.
JV: And the investment team? Any changes there?
JVE: We've added three partners since Fund V - all internal promotions. The team is now 45 people, including 12 partners. Average partner tenure is 12 years.
SW: We've also built out our data analytics team. They've been crucial in due diligence and value creation.
JV: What's your expectation for holding periods in the current market?
JVE: We're underwriting for 5-7 years, but our last three exits averaged 4.2 years. We're not in a hurry to exit the strong performers though - the software companies in particular have robust growth runways.
JV: This has been very helpful. Would it make sense to have a follow-up with our investment committee next week? They'd be particularly interested in diving deeper into your value creation approach.
JVE: Absolutely. We can share some case studies and bring our head of digital transformation. Would Wednesday work?
JV: Perfect. We'll set that up. Thanks again for your time.
